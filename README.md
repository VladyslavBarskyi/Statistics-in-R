# Projects
 
A series of independent projects in R, Python, and SQL: statistics and machine learning applied to various fields.

## Probability & Statistics (R)
 
[Convergence rate of the Poisson approximation to the Binomial](probability-statistics/poisson-binomial/poisson-binomial.md) Tests the accuracy of the Poisson approximation to the Binomial across a range of λ, using Total Variation Distance as the error metric. Finds the approximation holds within 3% error at λ = 12, and traces the residual error to the variance gap Var(X_Bin) = λ(1−p) < λ = Var(X_Pois). `R` `Total Variation Distance` `MGF`
 
[Empirical verification of the memoryless property of the Geometric distribution](probability-statistics/geometric-memoryless/geometric-memoryless.md) 50,000-trial Monte Carlo simulation confirming P(Y > a+b | Y > a) = P(Y > b) numerically, by conditioning on survival past a cutoff and comparing against a fresh baseline distribution. `R` `Monte Carlo Simulation`

## Regression & Machine Learning (Python, SQL)
 
[Forecasting inflation using macroeconomic indicators](Inflation_Forecasting/notebook/analysis.ipynb) Tests whether unemployment, the federal funds rate, and consumer sentiment predict US CPI inflation one month ahead (FRED, monthly, 1991–2026). Finds they do not: OLS and Ridge both return a negative R² against a persistence baseline, and adding the indicators to that baseline raises test RMSE by 13% while improving in-sample fit. `Python` `SQL` `Ridge Regression` `Time Series Cross-Validation`
